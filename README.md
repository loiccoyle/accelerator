<a href="https://github.com/loiccoyle/accelerator/actions?query=workflow%3Atests"><img src="https://github.com/loiccoyle/accelerator/workflows/tests/badge.svg"></a>

Python package to build simple toy accelerators.

# Dependencies:
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scipy

# Installation:
For now you will need to git clone the repository and install the package:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/loiccoyle/accelerator
cd accelerator
pip install .
```

In the near future I will publish it on Pypi.

It usualy a good idea to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). To create a virtual environment in the `venv` folder (assuming python3):
```sh
python -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```

Proceed with the installation to install in the virtual environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment:
 ```sh
 deactivate
 ```

# Usage:
See the `notebooks` folder for some examples.
